### ** I collaborated with another student, Hassan Razak, to complete this project**

In this project, I used TypeScript and object-oriented programming to build an e-commerce product management system. I created a Product class with properties and methods like displayDetails() and getPriceWithDiscount() to organize product data clearly. TypeScript’s type checking helped prevent errors and made the code easier to maintain.

Handling API calls asynchronously was a key part of the project. I used async/await with try/catch to manage requests and errors in an API service module. To handle errors better, I built a custom error class and an error handler function that catch and log issues clearly.

For discount and tax calculations, I wrote simple utility functions. The tax function applied different rates depending on the product category, since tax data wasn’t provided by the API. Separating these utilities kept the code clean and reusable.

Overall, working on this project helped me practice structuring code with classes, handling asynchronous operations, and managing errors effectively in TypeScript. It was a great way to apply these concepts in a real-world scenario. It was challenging to code in such a way that all of my code worked together properly.
